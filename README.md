🚀 Just built iTask, a to-do list app! 📝

Faced a couple of challenges: 1️⃣ JSON undefined error: Had to ensure localStorage data was properly initialized to avoid parsing null. 2️⃣ isCompleted not defined error: A quick fix in state management solved this.

Deepened my understanding of the useEffect hook, localStorage, and handling state in React. 💻

🔄 The edit and delete buttons are fully functional, and the "Show Finished" option lets you view completed tasks, which get a line-through effect when checked!
